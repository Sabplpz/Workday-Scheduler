# Challenge 05 - Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project was provided with starter code for us to finish it, it is meant to help with your day to day schedule and it'll let you know what day and time it is.
Very helpful to keep notes of what you need to do through out the day and maybe notes so that you don't forget. Just remember to update each day. I learnt a lot about bootstrap and dayjs with this one.

## Usage

This is meant for you to know tha day and time, please make notes in the big colored sections and it'll save them, it'll also save them if you delete them or change them. Feel free to use it in a daily basis to help with your day to day organization.
Below is an example of what you should find:
